1.	Install the package ”hflights” and load the library command 
2.	Convert to a local data frame (use command tbl_df)
3.	Convert to a normal data frame to see all of the columns
4.	base R approach & dplyr approach to view all flights on January 1 
5.	Select those flights where UniqueCarrier is “UA” or “AA”
6.	Pick columns by name - DepTime, ArrTime, FlightNum using base r and dplyr
7.	select UniqueCarrier and DepDelay columns and filter for delays over 60 minutes in dplyr
8.	use mutate to create a new variable Speed (in mph) and  display distance ,airtime and speed columns
9.	store the data into variable “flights”
10.	create a dataset grouped by Dest, and then summarise each group by taking the mean of ArrDelay
11.	for each day of the year, count the total number of flights and sort in descending order
12.	for each destination, count the total number of flights and the number of distinct planes that flew there
13.	for each destination, show the number of cancelled and not cancelled flights
